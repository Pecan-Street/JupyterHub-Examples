# JupyterHub-Examples
Example Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating use of Pecan Street data on our JupyterHub

## Use
Clone the repository with the command `git clone git@github.com:Pecan-Street/JupyterHub-Examples.git` either on your own computer, or from a terminal on the Pecan Street JupyterHub server.

Some of the notebooks require a Dataport database account to perform database queries and extract data.

If you have a Dataport database account, edit the config/config.txt file with the connection information from your https://dataport.pecanstreet.org/access page.
