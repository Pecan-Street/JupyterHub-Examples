Blucube data consists of the cumulative device reading (in gallons), so the water usage has been calculated for each interval by subtracting current interval reading from previous interval. After calculating delta usage, only those time intervals with a delta greater than 0 were included in the dataset. This data has then been joined with energy data to find how much electricity was used in those same time intervals when water was used in a home.\n"
